# Diabetes Predictor
The Diabetes Predictor leverages machine learning algorithms like SVM and Random Forest to predict the likelihood of diabetes in individuals based on various health metrics. This tool aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in making early and informed health decisions.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
The project includes pretrained models for efficient diabetes prediction, but please note that due to size limitations, the combined model Diabetes_model_all is not included here. You can easily use the available models or train your own for better accuracy.
There are 4 models:
1. Diabetes_model_all.pkl
2. Diabetes_model_knn.pkl
3. Diabetes_model_randomforest.pkl
4. Diabetes_model_xgbclassifier.pkl

From these 4 models, Diabetes_model_all and Diabetes_model_randomforest could not be uploaded due to large size.
